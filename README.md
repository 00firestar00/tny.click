# Tny.Click

## Image uploading service

This is built using Angular 6 and django.

Currently the server only runs in "development" mode 
where webpack will hot reload angular rather than it being built


The reasoning for all the Dockerfiles is because I want to test out multiple frontend frameworks, 
but don't like the idea of having Node installed locally.
Now they are nicely contained, and are not polluting my local env. :)
