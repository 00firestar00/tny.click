# Tny.Click

## Image uploading service

This is built using react and django.

Currently the server only runs in "development" mode 
where webpack will hot reload reactjs rather than it being built


The reasoning for all the Dockerfiles is because I want to test out react, 
but don't like the idea of having Node installed locally.
Now they are nicely contained, and are not polluting my local env. :)
